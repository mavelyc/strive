### Technology
* Google Firebase for the backend
* Google Cloud Vision API
* Twitter's Bootstrap Framework
* Fatsecret Nutritional API
* Spoonacular Recipe API

### Next Steps

We really hope to be able to continue this project and implement it on a local scale. Creating a group to track our own fitness and nutritional goals was one of the primary goals for this project, and we believe it's a good start. Beyond that, we truly believe this could help those without strong peer environments and positive influences a good way to find like-minded peers who share their goals and aspirations.
